Data files from the website:Â https://ourworldindata.org/meat-production, have been used for our analysis of meat consumption data across the world. After performing data cleanup, the excel files have been uploaded here and used for building ML models (using time series and regression algorithms). Using these models, we have predicted the meat consumption for the top 10 countries in the world and the impact of the meat consumption on enviromental factors like greenhouse gas emissions, agricultural land and freshwater use.
